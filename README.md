# Chess Algorithm Comparison (Minimax VS MCTS)

This is my Chess project for my stage 3 dissertation at Newcastle University

I have forked a [chess_console](https://github.com/jeromevonk/chess_console) project from this [article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214018/Chess-console-game-in-Cplusplus), but is now detached as there are no plans for merging.
